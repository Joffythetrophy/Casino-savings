The initial product aimed for a "Casino Savings" dApp with casino games, real betting, non-custodial savings, multi-currency wallet management (CRT, DOGE, TRX, USDC), "Smart Savings," and a "3-Treasury Wallet System," transitioning from simulated to real blockchain (DOGE, TRON, Solana, NOWPayments, Orca). A critical pivot occurred due to persistent fake transaction issues, leading to a new "Real Casino Savings System" focusing on real 21M CRT token integration. This system required real CRT wallet connection, betting, savings pools (losses to Orca liquidity), bridge pools, CRT withdrawals, and USDC-to-CRT conversion. However, the subsequent development largely shifted to creating isolated HTML demonstrations that simulate these features, incorporating specific user-provided HTML, branding (CRT logos, Orbitron font, tiger theme), and 3D game concepts, displaying a hardcoded 21M CRT balance.

Hey joffytrophy, Quick input needed :
Ask Question
Agent will continue working after your reply
GREAT NEWS! üéâ I can see Railway is actually making progress now! The nixpacks.toml file worked - Railway is no longer confused about your app structure.

CURRENT STATUS:

‚úÖ Nixpacks working - No more config parsing errors
‚úÖ Dependencies downloading - I can see fastapi, uvicorn, motor downloading
‚ùå Installation failing - Python packages having build issues
üîç THE ISSUE NOW:
The error shows: "failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1"

This means some Python packages in your requirements.txt need system dependencies to compile. Common culprits are packages that need:

gcc compiler
Python dev headers
System libraries
üõ†Ô∏è QUICK FIX - UPDATE NIXPACKS.TOML:
Go back to your GitHub repo and replace the nixpacks.toml content with this enhanced version:

[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs", "python3", "pip", "gcc", "python3-dev", "build-essential"]

[phases.install]
cmds = [
  "cd backend && pip install --upgrade pip",
  "cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt",
  "cd frontend && npm install"
]

[phases.build]
cmds = ["cd frontend && npm run build"]

[start]
cmd = "cd backend && uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000"
