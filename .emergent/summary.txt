The AI engineer successfully built the Casino Savings dApp from MVP to a feature-rich application. Initial efforts focused on frontend replication, UI fixes, and integrating core features like a wallet manager, crypto conversion, and smart savings. A significant phase involved moving from mock data to real-time CoinGecko API for prices, implementing user authentication, and creating an internal liquidity pool with dynamic withdrawal limits. The latest work centered on integrating real blockchain capabilities for DOGE, TRON, and Solana (CRT). This included fixing authentication persistence, resolving environment variable issues, and correcting a critical  key mismatch that prevented savings data from displaying. The system was enhanced with manual deposit mechanisms, username login, and liquidity adjustments. The current state leaves off with the user reporting a persistent login failure after the latest changes to the liquidity logic. The previous engineer was just about to debug this.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a casino savings dApp, designed for private use without public stats. Core features include a comprehensive **Casino Gameplay** (Keno, Plinko, Roulette, Dice, Mines, Slots) with real betting. A **Real Savings System** tracks game losses and automatically saves them into a savings vault with detailed transaction history, free of mock data. **Advanced Wallet Management** supports separate winnings and savings wallets, deposit/withdrawal, and crypto conversion for CRT, DOGE, TRX, and USDC. A unique smart savings logic saves total session gains. An **Internal Liquidity Pool** allows conversions for gameplay without external liquidity, funded by 10% (later 50%) of savings, with dynamic withdrawal limits. The application needed **Real-Money Blockchain Integration** for DOGE, TRON, and Solana (CRT), transitioning from database-managed balances. User authentication, including a username login, and a manual deposit system to avoid conflicts were also implemented. A future request for an AI auto-play betting system remains pending.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement the AI bets for me automatically / auto play on all game buttons feature.
-   Debug and fix the current Log in is not working bug reported by the user.
-   Further clarify user's intent regarding real doge not fake and fake crt for deposits, potentially setting up full blockchain-backed deposits instead of database credits if desired.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in troubleshooting a critical login issue. The user reported Log in is not working and reiterated Log in issues doesnt proceed. This occurred after a series of significant updates to the backend, including:
1.  **Login System Overhaul**: The  had been updated to correctly handle bcrypt password hashing for user accounts ( with password ) and to support username-based login via the  endpoint.
2.  **Liquidity Pool Adjustments**: The system was modified to allocate 50% of user savings to the liquidity pool (), and currency conversions were tested, showing the 50% contribution.
3.  **DOGE Deposit System**: A manual DOGE credit system () was implemented and tested.

The last recorded actions show the AI checking the supervisor status to confirm the backend was running (which it was), and then planning to test the backend login API directly to debug the reported issue. The system's login functionality, which was previously working with the new  username, seems to have regressed after the latest liquidity and deposit-related changes, or there's a new interaction causing the failure.
