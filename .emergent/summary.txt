The AI engineer's work pivoted from building a full-stack Real Casino Savings System using React/FastAPI/MongoDB/Solana Web3.js to generating multiple standalone HTML files. The user consistently provided complete HTML code snippets, asking the AI to fix them by populating with real CRT information and specific features. This led to the creation of five separate HTML demonstration pages (, , , , , ), each simulating or abstracting a different aspect of the dApp (dashboard, gaming, bridging, Solana integration, Trust Wallet, custom branding). The real aspects in these HTML files are primarily hardcoded user data (CRT balance, wallet address) and client-side JavaScript simulations, rather than actual backend or live blockchain interaction, despite one HTML file claiming Mainnet Integration while using Devnet in code. The original  codebase seems to have been set aside.

<product_requirements>
The initial product aimed for a Casino Savings dApp with casino games, real betting, non-custodial savings, multi-currency wallet management (CRT, DOGE, TRX, USDC), Smart Savings, and a 3-Treasury Wallet System, transitioning from simulated to real blockchain (DOGE, TRON, Solana, NOWPayments, Orca). A critical pivot occurred due to persistent fake transaction issues, leading to a new Real Casino Savings System focusing on real 21M CRT token integration. This system required real CRT wallet connection, betting, savings pools (losses to Orca liquidity), bridge pools, CRT withdrawals, and USDC-to-CRT conversion. However, the subsequent development largely shifted to creating isolated HTML demonstrations that simulate these features, incorporating specific user-provided HTML, branding (CRT logos, Orbitron font, tiger theme), and 3D game concepts, displaying a hardcoded 21M CRT balance.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for client-side logic and UI.
- **Blockchain Simulation**: Client-side JS simulating wallet connection, transactions, and balance updates.
- **Solana Web3.js**: Library used for *simulated* (or Devnet) Solana blockchain interaction within one HTML demo.
- **Wallet Adapters**: Generic integration for Trust Wallet, MetaMask, Phantom (simulated).
- **UI/UX Design**: Custom styling, gradients, animations, and responsive layouts.
- **Game Mechanics**: Client-side logic for slots, horse racing, coin flip.

<code_architecture>
The codebase initially had two main parts: the deprecated  directory and the new  directory intended for the full-stack application.



**New Files (Standalone HTML, current focus):**
-   ****: A dashboard UI to display a hardcoded 21M CRT balance and portfolio value, with action buttons and a casino theme. Created to address fake balance issues in a previous attempt.
-   ****: A complete gaming platform UI featuring a functional slot machine with betting controls, auto-play, balance management, and transaction modals. Uses hardcoded CRT/USDC/SOL balances.
-   ****: An interface for bridge and Orca pool deposits, displaying fixed CRT/SOL/USDC balances, a bridge address, and simulated deposit processes. Corrected a previous 0 CRT balance display issue.
-   ****: Demonstrates (simulated) Solana blockchain interaction, including Phantom wallet connection, SOL/USDC/CRT balance display (mocked/hardcoded for tokens, real for SOL on Devnet), deposit/withdrawal forms, and Orca pool liquidity.
-   ****: A comprehensive crypto dashboard with simulated multi-wallet (Trust, MetaMask, Phantom) integration, real-time (simulated) price tickers, casino performance stats (wins/losses), and transaction history.
-   ****: A casino interface with specific CRT branding, including custom wallpaper, animated logos, Orbitron font, and casino-themed game cards, displaying a hardcoded CRT portfolio.

**Note:** The  directory, originally intended for the main application, was not directly modified in the recent trajectory.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully activate NOWPayments payout permissions (from old system, likely not applicable now).
- Implement real Jupiter aggregator submission for CRT (from old system, not addressed).
- Facilitate real liquidity (CRT, SOL, USDC) for Orca pools with real on-chain transfers (from old system, not addressed by HTML demos).
- Frontend testing for the  React components (e.g., , ).
- Integrate the  component into  and add a corresponding route.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on creating a custom-branded CRT Casino. The user provided a complete HTML file for CRT Casino with 3D Games (Chat Message 63), asking for an interface with multiple 3D games (horse racing, various slots, provably fair games), auto-play, and betting controls, all with CRT branding and real CRT token context. The AI engineer successfully created the  based on a prior request (Chat Message 57-62) and was in the process of creating the  based on the latest request, having just confirmed the creation of the  and summarizing its features. The state is that a new HTML file is expected to be generated to demonstrate these 3D games.

<optional_next_step>
Create the  file as requested by the user.
