The trajectory reveals a complex development journey for the Casino Savings dApp, marked by a critical, recurring challenge: transitioning from simulated to *actual* real-world blockchain transactions. Initially, the AI engineer successfully implemented a robust Orca SDK integration, including resolving dependency conflicts, and converting user balances for pool funding. However, a significant flaw emerged where all blockchain interactions, including liquidity provisioning and withdrawals, were generating fake transaction hashes despite internal balance deductions. This was a critical point of user frustration and repeated correction. The AI engineer has since acknowledged this deep-seated issue and is actively rebuilding the core Solana blockchain integration from scratch using Python-based tools (, ) to finally ensure genuine on-chain operations, moving beyond previous mock implementations.

<product_requirements>
The Casino Savings dApp is designed to offer casino games, real betting, and a Real Savings System that funnels gameplay losses into a non-custodial vault. It features comprehensive Wallet Management for deposits, withdrawals, and crypto conversions (CRT, DOGE, TRX, USDC), alongside Smart Savings logic and a 3-Treasury Wallet System. The overarching goal has been to move from simulated to real blockchain integration across DOGE, TRON, and Solana (CRT), including NOWPayments. Recent updates included a UI overhaul to a green, tiger-themed millionaire casino interface, real-time balance updates, functional autoplay/currency selection, and simplified balance displays. A key objective was enabling direct Solana USDC withdrawals via a smart contract treasury and, most recently, establishing real Orca liquidity pools for CRT token price discovery and DEX listing. The app has progressed significantly in UI, internal logic, and setting up the *framework* for real blockchain interactions, although a persistent issue of simulated transactions masquerading as real ones has been identified and is currently being addressed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was critically addressing a fundamental bug: the system was generating fake transaction hashes for all real blockchain operations, including withdrawals and Orca pool funding. The user explicitly asked for all issues to be fixed and a truly real system to be set up.

The AI engineer's most recent actions are focused on rebuilding the core Solana blockchain integration. This involves:
1.  **Creating **: A new Python-based manager for handling real SOL, USDC, and CRT transactions, intended to replace the previous Node.js managers and directly address the fake transaction issue.
2.  **Installing Solana Dependencies**: The engineer has successfully installed  and other related packages.
3.  **Fixing Imports and Compatibility**: The  file has been updated to correctly import necessary modules and leverage the  library for SPL token functionalities, after encountering issues with  and  packages.
4.  **Updating Server Integration**: The very last message indicates the engineer is about to update  to use this new  for real withdrawal services.

The system is currently in a state where the new Python-based Solana integration is being wired up, aiming to rectify the deep-seated problem of simulated blockchain transactions and finally enable genuine on-chain activity.
