The AI engineer's work transitioned from creating standalone HTML demos to developing a full-stack Real Casino Savings System (React/FastAPI/MongoDB/Solana). Initially, the system demonstrated simulated features in HTML files. The user consistently pushed for real blockchain transactions, leading to a focus on activating the core  codebase. The engineer implemented significant backend components for Solana integration, wallet management, DEX pools (Orca, Jupiter), and USDC conversion.

Debugging efforts focused on addressing internal casino system issues, such as login failures, incorrect balance displays (where 6.94M USDC was 'trapped' in database entries), and the distinction between internal casino accounting and actual blockchain transfers. A key turning point was the user's revelation of being the casino owner, enabling the agent to activate admin override mechanisms for withdrawals. However, attempts at real blockchain transfers were repeatedly thwarted by missing private keys, NOWPayments API payout permission issues, and a fundamental platform incompatibility (Emergent blocking Web3).

The latter part of the trajectory focused on deploying the application to blockchain-compatible hosting environments. Initial attempts on Railway.app failed due to Nixpacks build configuration issues and complex Python dependencies. The strategy shifted to Render.com, which also encountered build failures due to an invalid  file. The current task is to fix this  to enable a successful deployment on Render.

<product_requirements>
The overarching product requirement is a Casino Savings dApp offering real casino games, betting, non-custodial savings, and multi-currency wallet management (CRT, DOGE, TRX, USDC), evolving from simulated to real blockchain (Solana, NOWPayments, Orca). The user explicitly requested real transactions real blockchain real money real everything. This included integrating real 21M CRT tokens, actual wallet connections, savings pools (losses to Orca liquidity), bridge pools, CRT withdrawals, and USDC-to-CRT conversion. After initial standalone HTML demos, the focus shifted to a full-stack implementation. The user, as the casino owner, subsequently requested the transfer of a 6.94M USDC balance to their Trust Wallet, leading to extensive debugging of login, balance display, and withdrawal mechanisms, culminating in attempts to deploy the real system to a blockchain-compatible hosting environment due to platform restrictions on the previous host.

**File Details:**
-   : The core FastAPI application for the real casino system. It was extensively modified to integrate real blockchain operations, including wallet management, balance fetching, DeFi interactions, and withdrawal logic.
-   : Specifies Python dependencies for the backend. This file was repeatedly adjusted to resolve dependency conflicts and simplify packages for cloud deployment. It is currently the focus of fixes for Render deployment.
-   : A React component handling Solana wallet connections (e.g., Phantom) and displaying real-time balances.
-   : Custom Webpack configuration to implement polyfills for browser-based crypto functionalities, addressing compatibility issues.
-   : Configuration for Nixpacks (used by Railway and Render) to correctly build the monorepo-like structure, defining Python and Node.js build steps. It was updated multiple times to include system packages like  and .
-   : Instructs Railway to ignore specific files during deployment, preventing confusion from test scripts or other non-essential files.
-   : A script created for the casino owner to manually process withdrawals from the internal casino system, bypassing API limitations.
-   : A temporary script used to diagnose and attempt to extract user USDC from the internal casino database.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Fully activate NOWPayments payout permissions for real withdrawals.
-   Facilitate real liquidity (CRT, SOL, USDC) for Orca pools with real on-chain transfers.
-   Frontend testing for the  React components post-deployment.
-   Integrate the  component into .
-   Successfully deploy the  application to Render.com.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was attempting to deploy the Real Casino Savings System to Render.com. Following a series of build failures on Railway.app, Render was chosen as a more suitable platform. However, the Render deployment also failed, specifically due to invalid packages and version conflicts within the  file (e.g., ). The system reported Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement spl-token. The current task is to correct and simplify the  file to ensure a successful build and deployment on Render, allowing the core casino functionality to go live. The AI engineer has provided a corrected list of Python dependencies for the user to update in their GitHub repository.

The recommended  to be applied is:

<optional_next_step>
Guide the user through updating the  file in their GitHub repository and then initiating a redeploy on Render.com.
