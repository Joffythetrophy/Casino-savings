The previous AI engineer initiated development of a Casino Savings dApp. This trajectory details progress from core feature integration to robust blockchain capabilities and UI enhancements. Initially, the focus was on frontend replication, wallet management, crypto conversion, and smart savings. Significant work involved moving from mock data to real CoinGecko API, implementing user authentication, an internal liquidity pool, and real blockchain integration for DOGE, TRON, and Solana (CRT). The engineer meticulously addressed login failures, fake balance displays, incorrect CRT addresses, and simulated DOGE deposits. A crucial phase involved implementing an AI auto-play betting system across casino games. Most recently, the engineer tackled a critical bug regarding fake withdrawals. They had just begun implementing real blockchain withdrawals for all supported cryptocurrencies when the trajectory ended. The overall progress shows a complex dApp moving towards a fully decentralized, real-money system.

<product_requirements>
The dApp is a private casino savings application with no public stats. It features a full suite of Casino Games (Keno, Plinko, Roulette, Dice, Mines, Slots) with real betting. A Real Savings System automatically saves game losses to a non-custodial savings vault with transaction history. Advanced Wallet Management supports winnings and savings wallets, deposits/withdrawals, and crypto conversion for CRT, DOGE, TRX, and USDC. Smart savings logic saves total session gains. An Internal Liquidity Pool, funded by 10% of savings, allows gameplay conversions with dynamic withdrawal limits. Real-Money Blockchain Integration for DOGE, TRON, and Solana (CRT) was paramount, transitioning from database balances. User authentication, including username login, and a manual deposit system were implemented. Pending features include an AI auto-play betting system and later, real blockchain transfers for savings. Critical fixes included login, real DOGE address generation, accurate CRT integration, and ensuring real blockchain withdrawals.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the implementation of real blockchain transfers for Solana (CRT/SPL tokens) in  for withdrawals.
-   Implement real blockchain transfers for the non-custodial savings vault (currently simulated).
-   Address any further refinements for visual displays and user experience as per user feedback (e.g., more clear savings details in the savings menu).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in fixing critical issues related to the withdrawal system and ensuring all financial operations were backed by real blockchain transactions, not simulations. The user reported that a previously successful 500 USDC withdrawal to an external wallet did not actually occur. This led to a crucial realization by the AI engineer that the withdrawal system was fake/simulated.

The AI engineer has committed to:
1.  Refunding the user's 500 USDC balance.
2.  Resetting USDC and CRT saved amounts as requested.
3.  Implementing a real blockchain withdrawal system.
4.  Adding proper blockchain transaction verification before reporting success.

In response, the engineer has already started modifying the backend:
-   's  function has been updated to call specific blockchain manager methods (, , , ) for each currency.
-    has been updated with the  method for real DOGE transfers.
-    has been updated with the  method for real TRX transfers.
-   The engineer was in the process of adding the Solana-specific methods ( and ) to  when the trajectory ended.

The system is currently in a state where real blockchain withdrawal logic is being actively integrated across multiple cryptocurrency managers to fulfill the user's request for genuine, verifiable transactions.
