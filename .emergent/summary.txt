The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack Casino Savings dApp, starting from a pixel-perfect clone of a provided website. Initial work focused on replicating the frontend UI with mock data, quickly achieving a functional and visually accurate prototype. Upon user confirmation, backend integration commenced, leveraging FastAPI and MongoDB, with a critical focus on real Solana blockchain integration for CRT, DOGE, and TRX tokens, guided by an external playbook. The project evolved from a basic savings tracker to a comprehensive casino platform featuring multiple games, real betting, and a sophisticated smart savings system that accounts for session winnings even if the final outcome is a loss. Throughout the process, the AI engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, addressing frontend JSX errors and adapting to existing component structures (e.g., Shadcn UI). The latest work involves refactoring the app to remove all mock data, integrate real blockchain transactions for savings and game outcomes, and implement a detailed wallet management system with separate wallets for winnings and savings, alongside crypto conversion features, aligning with the user's explicit shift towards a fully functional, private, and real-money application. The next step involves completing the frontend integration of the new wallet system.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a pixel-perfect clone of  to serve as a casino savings application. The core requirement was to integrate real Solana blockchain functionality, specifically using CRT tokens as the primary currency, along with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Tron (TRX), with no mocked data.

Further requirements evolved to include:
1.  **Comprehensive Casino Gameplay**: Implementation of various casino games like Keno, Plinko, Roulette, Dice, Mines, Slots, and Chess, featuring real gameplay with animations and betting mechanics.
2.  **CRT Token Integration**: Prominent display and functional use of user-provided CRT token images throughout the app as the main coin.
3.  **Real Savings System**:
    *   Automatic savings of amounts lost in casino games into a savings vault.
    *   A detailed savings dashboard table showing transaction history (date, game, currency, amount saved, multiplier missed, result, running total).
    *   Removal of all mock/test data for the savings system.
4.  **Private User Experience**: Removal of public-facing statistics (e.g., players online, CRT wagered) to ensure the app is for private self-savings.
5.  **Advanced Wallet Management**:
    *   Separate wallets for winnings and savings.
    *   Deposit and withdrawal functionalities.
    *   A crypto conversion feature (e.g., converting crypto to Solana, TRX, or DOGE).
    *   **Smart Savings Logic**: If a user deposits an amount (e.g., 20 DOGE), gains winnings (e.g., 1000 DOGE), and then loses all of it by the end of the session, the total gained amount (1000 DOGE + initial 20 DOGE) should be considered as saved for the session.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of implementing the advanced wallet management system and smart savings logic based on the user's latest, detailed requirements.

The specific actions taken were:
1.  **Backend Updates**:
    *   : Models were replaced or updated () to support separate  and  wallets and likely new transaction types. New wallet management endpoints were added () for deposit, withdrawal, and crypto conversion.
2.  **Frontend Component Creation**:
    *   : A new component was created to house the UI for managing different wallets (winnings, savings), deposit/withdrawal features, and crypto conversion. This component likely utilizes the Shadcn  component for navigation between these features. ().
3.  **Dependency Installation**:
    *    was installed to support the  component's UI ().
4.  **UI Updates**:
    *    () and  () were updated to remove public-facing statistics (ppl online, CRT wagered) to align with the private savings application requirement.

The current immediate task, as per , is to update  to include the route for the  and update the  component to include a link to this new wallet page. This indicates that the core backend structure for the new wallet system is in place, and the frontend UI for it has been scaffolded, but it's not yet fully integrated into the application's navigation flow.
