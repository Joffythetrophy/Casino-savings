App offering real casino games, betting, non-custodial savings, and multi-currency wallet management (CRT, DOGE, TRX, USDC), evolving from simulated to real blockchain (Solana, NOWPayments, Orca). The user explicitly requested "real transactions real blockchain real money real everything." This included integrating real 21M CRT tokens, actual wallet connections, savings pools (losses to Orca liquidity), bridge pools, CRT withdrawals, and USDC-to-CRT conversion. After initial standalone HTML demos, the focus shifted to a full-stack implementation. The user, as the casino owner, subsequently requested the transfer of a 6.94M USDC balance to their Trust Wallet, leading to extensive debugging of login, balance display, and withdrawal mechanisms, culminating in attempts to deploy the real system to a blockchain-compatible hosting environment due to platform restrictions on the previous host.

Hey joffytrophy, Quick input needed :
I can see you're in your GitHub repository! Perfect. Now we need to navigate to the specific requirements.txt file that needs to be updated.

From what I can see in your screenshot, you're currently viewing what appears to be a README or documentation file. Here's how to get to the requirements.txt file:

Step-by-step navigation:

Look for the file browser/directory structure - usually on the left side or main area of the GitHub page
Navigate to: real_casino_system folder (click on it)
Then go to: backend folder (click on it)
Find and click on: requirements.txt file
Alternative quick method:

Use the GitHub search bar at the top and type: requirements.txt
Select the one in real_casino_system/backend/requirements.txt
Once you're viewing the requirements.txt file, you'll see an "Edit" button (pencil icon) in the top right of the file view. Click that and then:

Select all the current content (Ctrl+A)
Delete it completely
Paste the corrected requirements.txt I provided earlier:
